I am pursuing a Master’s degree in Computer Science at [Bowling Green State University (BGSU), OH, USA](https://www.bgsu.edu/), where I serve as a research assistant under the supervision of [Dr. Abbas Heydarnoori](https://heydarnoori.github.io/). My research focuses on applying artificial intelligence to software engineering (AI4SE), with an emphasis on large language model (LLM) agents, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), vector databases, and knowledge graphs for issue report management. As part of this broad research endeavor, I have contributed to the design and implementation of [LinkAnchor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12232), an autonomous LLM-based agent for issue–commit link recovery that outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 262% in Hit@1 accuracy.

I am currently developing similar approaches for other critical issue management tasks, including issue report classification, which is important for software maintenance and security, and automatic bug reproducibility test generation, which supports downstream tasks such as automated program repair.

In addition to my academic research, I have strong industry experience as a software engineer at prominent tech companies, including [Digikala](https://www.digikala.com/), the largest e-commerce platform in the Middle East.

I received my Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering from Sharif University of Technology.
